痛み　嘆き　寄せ集めた憎しみに焼かれながら  
踏み出す道　身体中刺さる棘  
地獄の森　針山のようね  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Smouldering in hatred, pain and sorrow fused,  
Piercing the body on the path you tread  
Just like the Needle Mountains of the forests of Hell  
{: .lyrics-en}

絶望と希望　侮蔑　強欲　渦巻く俗世に踊らされて  
人は誰も皆　傷付かず生きられない宿命なら  
そう　此処に置いてゆけばいい  
忌まわしい過去も　魔力にして光らせるよ  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Despair and hope, disdain and greed; you'll be swept away in this whirling mortal coil  
As it is all and sundry's destiny not to live their lives without harm  
So leave your miserable past behind henceforth  
And shine under this spell  
{: .lyrics-en}

降り積もる哀しみ　漆黒い氷雪が日常を凍て尽くすのなら  
君の涙と成りて咲かせましょう  
虹色そよぐ紫陽花　揺らめけ　美しく  
{: .lyrics-jp}

If the jet black snowfall of sorrow freezes the day-to-day solid,  
then let us grow, from your own tears,  
Hortensias sparkling in rainbow colours. Shimmering, beautiful  
{: .lyrics-en}

困難を避ける傘ばかりを求めて何処へ向かうの？  
極楽色　幻想を追い掛けても  
疼く傷は癒せぬままでしょう？  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Where will your dire quest after straw hats to shelter from inclemency take you?  
Do you not realise your sore wounds will not heal  
Even if you pursue your paradisiacal dreams?  
{: .lyrics-en}

歓びと怒り　嘘と現実　蠢く俗世を手繰り寄せて  
真実の愛は　挑む心だけに映り込むもの  
さあ　厭わず歩み出して　尽きぬ苦しみは  
この生命に刻みつけて  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Joy and anger, lies and truths; they all draw this squirming mortal coil  
As true love only manifests in a struggling soul  
So set out undeterred upon your path now  
And carve the endless suffering of it upon your life  
{: .lyrics-en} 

降り止まぬ哀しみ　深い冥闇も強き祈りで照らして  
芽吹く想い　廻る季節に乗せ  
君色彩る紫陽花　輝け　誇らしく  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Illuminate the dark gloom of the unceasing snowfall of sorrow with your zealous prayer  
Let us throw your budding feelings to the seasons, and grow  
Hortensias shining in your own colour. Gleaming, proud  
{: .lyrics-en}

呼吸をする様に浮かぶ煩悩　百八の鐘を鳴らしながら  
傷つけ合う度　許し許され生きゆく運命なら  
そう　此処に置いてゆけばいい  
重ねた罪さえ　魔力にして光らせるよ  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Worldly desires emerge, as natural as drawing breath, while a hundred and eight bells toll their names[^bells],  
Since it is all and sundry's destiny to forgive and be forgiven after harming one another  
So leave your amassed sins behind henceforth  
And shine under this spell  
{: .lyrics-en}

降り積もる哀しみ　漆黒い氷雪が明日を埋め尽くすのなら  
伴に涙と成りて咲かせましょう  
虹色そよぐ紫陽花　揺らめけ　美しく  
{: .lyrics-jp}

If the jet black snowfall of sorrow blankets tomorrow entirely,  
then let us grow, together from our own tears,  
Hortensias sparkling in rainbow colours. Shimmering, beautiful  
{: .lyrics-en}

咲かせて　君だけのその煌めき  
咲かせて　儚き花弁散る瞬間まで  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Bloom, bloom with a radiance that is yours alone  
Bloom, bloom until the moment your ephemeral petals scatter  
{: .lyrics-en}

[^bells]: The 108 bells mentioned in this verse are a direct reference to *Joya no Kane* (``除夜の鐘``), a Buddhist event where a bell is tolled 108 times, each toll corresponding to one of the *kleshas*, the Buddhist synonym of worldy desires or afflictions. These negative emotions are told to dominate the people of this world at times and guide some aspects of their lives. This song relies heavily on them and mentions to some of these *kleshas* can be seen throughout the lyrics.
