One of my favourite Akatsuki Records' songs. An amazing piece with lots of intricacies, references and a solid, legendary undertone. Thanks a lot to [NaokiP][naoki]{: .link} and [Tsubasa Cat][kevin]{: .link} for their help.

暗闇に生まれ　赤い瞳炎宿し  
そこに映るのは太陽  
神をも焼く深淵の太陽  
    
空、続く路知る黒烏[^dark-raven]  
今、地にいずるTotal eclipse of the sun  

Born from shadows, a red eye harboring flames,  
Upon it reflects a sun, an abyssal one that burns even the gods  
O dark raven[^dark-raven], thee who knows the way to the skies,  
Take off from this Earth for a total eclipse of the sun  
{: .lyrics-en}

ATOMICA TOKAMAK　弧を描いて走るプラズマ  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　赤く赤く胸に秘めたInner core  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　九つ射て堕ちた烏が  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　その身燃やし再び陽となる    

ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a burst of plasma draws an arc  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a crimson red inner core concealed within its chest  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, nine felled crows fell from the skies  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, and their bodies, set alight, shall become suns once more  
{: .lyrics-en}

たった一つだけ残して  
落星の欠片は地底へ  
マントルに眠る火輪は地底へ  
やがて光を求めて  

空、続く路知る黒烏  
今、地を抜けるTotal eclipse of the sun  

With only one remaining, the husk of this fallen star hides beneath the earth,  
A sleeping ring of fire in the mantle begging for light by and by  
O dark raven, thee who knows the way to the skies,  
Split this Earth for a total eclipse of the sun

ATOMICA TOKAMAK　弧を描いて走るプラズマ  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　赤く赤く胸に秘めたInner core  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　九つ射て堕ちた烏が

ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a burst of plasma draws an arc

ATOMICA TOKAMAK, nine felled crows fell from the skies  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, and their bodies, set alight, shall become suns once more

闇、十日が昇り　三足烏の影に  
	
Out from the dark, ten suns rise once more—In the shadow of the three-legged raven 
{: .lyrics-en} 
  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　弧を描いて走るプラズマ  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　赤く赤く胸に秘めたInner core  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　矢に射られて堕ちた烏が  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　神を宿し滅びの陽となる時  
	
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a burst of plasma draws an arc  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a crimson red inner core concealed within its chest  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, struck by the arrow, the crow fell  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, and, harboring a god, shall become a sun of destruction

[^dark-raven]: ``黒烏 (kokuu, black crow)`` works as the contrapositive of ``金烏 (kin'u, golden crow)``, the latter being used in ancient times to refer to the sun and, by extension, the three-legged crow. An amazing subtlety skillfully caught by [Naoki][naoki]{: .link}.
