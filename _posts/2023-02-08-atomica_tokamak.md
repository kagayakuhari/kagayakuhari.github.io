One of my favourite Akatsuki Records' songs. An amazing piece with lots of intricacies, references and a solid, legendary undertone. Thanks a lot to [NaokiP][naoki]{: .link} and [Tsubasa Cat][kevin]{: .link} for their help.

暗闇に生まれ　赤い瞳炎宿し  
そこに映るのは太陽  
神をも焼く深淵の太陽  
{: .lyrics-jp}
    
空、続く路知る黒烏[^dark-raven]  
今、地にいずるTotal eclipse of the sun  
{: .lyrics-jp}

Born from shadows, a red eye harbouring flames,  
Upon it reflects a sun, an abyssal one that burns even the gods  
O dark raven[^dark-raven], thee who knows the way to the skies,  
Take off from this Earth for a total eclipse of the sun  
{: .lyrics-en}

ATOMICA TOKAMAK　弧を描いて走るプラズマ  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　赤く赤く胸に秘めたInner core  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　九つ射て堕ちた烏が  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　その身燃やし再び陽となる    
{: .lyrics-jp}

ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a burst of plasma draws an arc  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a crimson red inner core concealed within its chest  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, nine felled crows fell from the skies  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, and their bodies, set alight, shall become suns once more  
{: .lyrics-en}

たった一つだけ残して  
落星の欠片は地底へ  
マントルに眠る火輪は地底へ  
やがて光を求めて  
{: .lyrics-jp}

空、続く路知る黒烏  
今、地を抜けるTotal eclipse of the sun  
{: .lyrics-jp}

With only one remaining, the husk of this fallen star hides beneath the earth,  
A sleeping ring of fire in the mantle begging for light by and by  
O dark raven, thee who knows the way to the skies,  
Split this Earth for a total eclipse of the sun

ATOMICA TOKAMAK　弧を描いて走るプラズマ

ATOMICA TOKAMAK　九つ射て堕ちた烏が

闇、十日が昇り　三足烏の影に

Out from the dark, ten suns rise once more—In the shadow of the three-legged raven 
{: .lyrics-en} 
  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　弧を描いて走るプラズマ  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　赤く赤く胸に秘めたInner core  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　矢に射られて堕ちた烏が  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK　神を宿し滅びの陽となる時  
{: .lyrics-jp}
	
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a burst of plasma draws an arc  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, a crimson red inner core concealed within its chest  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, struck by the arrow, the crow fell  
ATOMICA TOKAMAK, and, harbouring a god, shall become a sun of destruction

[^dark-raven]: ``黒烏 (kokuu, black crow)`` works as the contrapositive of ``金烏 (kin'u, golden crow)``, the latter being used in ancient times to refer to the sun and, by extension, the three-legged crow. An amazing subtlety skilfully caught by [Naoki][naoki]{: .link}.
