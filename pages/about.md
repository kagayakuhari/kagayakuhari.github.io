I'm [kagayakuhari][twitter]{: .link}.  <!-- br -->

I do cybersecurity research. My main interests are low-level embedded systems,
reverse engineering of Linux binaries and binary exploitation. I also translate
Japanese media into English and Spanish from time to time.

The easiest way to contact me is through [Twitter][twitter]{: .link} or [email][email]{: .link}.
